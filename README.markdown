PortFusion is a minimalistic, cross-platform, transport-layer distributed
reverse / forward proxy for TCP released under [GPLv3](#license).

A single package that makes the most of each platform by tapping into their
unique capabilities, combining this power with an intuitive interface, beautiful
design and [Haskell]'s excellent support for unprecedented levels of concurrency
and parallelism.

It strives for the smallest source code size while delivering maximum throughput
with near zero overhead.


## Notice

```
This is the new Haskell source code repository of the latest ]-[ayabusa version
– a complete rewrite of the initial Windows-only versions developed in F# / C#.

## Build

### Requirements

| OS           | Compilers           |
|:-------------|:--------------------|
| ![Windows]   | [Haskell Platform] >= 2011.4.0.0
| ![Linux], ![OSX], ![FreeBSD], ![OpenBSD], ![Solaris], ![Other] | [GHC] >= 7 <br /> [LLVM] >= 3

### Instructions

```bash
git   clone      git://github.com/corsis/PortFusion.git
cd    PortFusion
cabal update
cabal configure
cabal install
```


## Use

| Distributed Reverse Proxy Mode  | Distributed Forward Proxy Mode |
|:-------------------------------:|:-------------------------------|
| |
| <p>You have a Linux PC at home `remote` and two Windows PCs behind a corporate firewall at work: the gateway `local` and your personal workstation `server`.</p> <p>You open port `2000` at `remote` and tunnel incoming RDP traffic at port `3389` on `remote` to your workstation `server` via gateway `local`.</p> | <p>A friend is operating an http proxy server `server:3128` and has only one gateway PC in his network that accepts incoming connections from the public internet `remote`.</p> <p>You `local` want to connect to the internet through your friend's http proxy `server:3128` to access websites blocked by your current internet service provider.</p>
| |
| `@remote>` <pre>PortFusion             ] 2000        [</pre> `@local>` <pre>PortFusion 3389 server - 2000 remote [ 3389</pre> | `@remote>` <pre>PortFusion      ]        2000 [</pre> `@local>` <pre>PortFusion 3128 ] remote 2000 - server 3128</pre>
| |
| <p>You can now connect to `remote:3389` with your favourite remote desktop client. All connections will be tunneled via gateway `local` to your workstation `server`.</p> <p>You only need to configure the firewall at your own home PC `remote` for port `2000`.</p> | <p>`local` HTTP clients that connects to the tunneled proxy `local:3128` are served by your friend's http proxy `server:3128` via gateway`remote`.</p> <p>Your friend only needs to configure the firewall on gateway `remote` for port `2000`.</p>

## Know

### Principles

Development follows simple principles:

1. Be concise: [PortFusion is a single-file with less than 500 lines of code](https://github.com/corsis/PortFusion/blob/master/src/Main.hs)
2. Refactor and prune *constantly*
3. Push and keep code where it belongs
 1. Create [fully documented reusable libraries](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/splice) that [cover common needs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10080670/using-gnu-linux-system-call-splice-for-zero-copy-socket-to-socket-data-transfe)
 2. [Report bugs and work on fixes](https://github.com/haskell/network/issues/31)
4. Share *everything*
 1. [Use the most permissive licenses possible](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/splice)
 2. [Illustrate every concept in detail worthy of books](#illustrate)
5. [Provide excellent support](https://sourceforge.net/p/portfusion/discussion/general/thread/7ad0cb49/)
6. Grow true to your principles

### Family

We hope to grow a whole family of software-defined networking solutions reaching
all network layers, technologies and devices.

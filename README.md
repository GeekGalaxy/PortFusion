## Warning!

This is an extremely volatile experimental branch in which I entertain the freedom of rewriting (parts of)
PortFusion in C.

Motivations are twofold:
+ offer support for smaller embedded devices than one can target with today's GHC
+ seamless integration with OpenWrt's build system to be placed in OpenWrt kernel images

Everything in this branch enjoys the following rights **at all times**:
+ the right to crash
+ the right to work
+ the right to be utterly broken beyond all hope
+ the right to continue its existence, be cared for and fixed
+ the right to end its existence, be forgotten and gone


## Network Protocols

+ PortFusion(/Haskell) 1.0 or above


## Directories & Files

```
PortFusion                     # directory to put under openwrt/package/
PortFusion/Makefile            # OpenWrt 'make menuconfig' integration

PortFusion/src                 # PortFusion/C directory
PortFusion/src/Makefile        # PortFusion/C makefile
PortFusion/src/README          # PortFusion/C how-to-make file
PortFusion/src/pf.c            # PortFusion/C
```


## Dependencies

+ OS with BSD sockets API
+ POSIX Threads library
+ Luck and/or expertise


## Build as part of a OpenWrt kernel image

```
git clone git://nbd.name/openwrt.git
cd openwrt
./scripts/feeds update
./scripts/feeds install
make package/symlinks
cd package
git clone git://github.com/corsis/PortFusion.git -b ρφμ
cd ..
make menuconfig # find and *-select: "Corsis Research" > "pfl"
make
```

## Build as a tiny stand-alone binary

```
git clone git://github.com/corsis/PortFusion.git -b ρφμ
cd PortFusion/src
make
```

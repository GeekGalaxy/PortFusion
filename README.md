This is an experi-fucking-mental branch in which I entertain the freedom of rewriting (parts of) PortFusion in C.

# Directory & File Structure

```
PortFusion                     # directory to put under openwrt/package/
PortFusion/Makefile            # OpenWrt 'make menuconfig' integration

PortFusion/src                 # PortFusion/C directory
PortFusion/src/Makefile        # PortFusion/C makefile
PortFusion/src/README          # PortFusion/C how-to-make file
PortFusion/src/pf.c            # PortFusion/C
```
